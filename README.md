# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Crop disease estimation plays a crucial role in food security, disease management and yield loss prediction but its identification process require a proper infrastructure which is laborious as well as costly. Recent advancement in the technologies has provided us with a deep convolutional neural network model which detect and diagnose plant leaves images of healthy and diseased plants. Using the PlantVillage dataset which offer 6,002 images, of 14 different crop species including around 1000 pictures collected on our own in order to maintain the dataset extensiveness. The trained model achieves success rate of about 98.09% on the hold-out test set. The proposed system can effectively produce the desired results an identify different types of disease effectively and accurately and generate remedy for the disease.
